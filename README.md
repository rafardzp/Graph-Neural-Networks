# Graph Neural Networks
Repository containing *.ipynb files with practice code and projects based on Graph Theory and GNNs. Most of the content is based on the publicly available [GitHub repository](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Graph-Neural-Networks-Using-Python) of the book [Hands-On Graph Neural Networks Using Python by Maxime Labonne](https://www.packtpub.com/product/hands-on-graph-neural-networks-using-python/9781804617526?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781804617526), although implementation is mine.

### Subjects
1. Graph Theory: basics of graph theory and graph generation.
2. Fundamentals of Graph Learning: node embeddings, intro to GNNs, GCNs and GATs.
3. Advanced Topics: GrpahSAGE, predicting links, generating graphs, temporal graph networks, explainable graph networks, etc.
4. Projects: forecasting traffic, detecting anomaliesand building a recommender system.
